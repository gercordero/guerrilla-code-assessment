## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Things to improve and comments

I dedicated a total of 3 hours and 40 minutes to almost completing this assessment. The only unfinished section is the final part before the footer. However, I prioritized the essential tasks, which involved implementing contentful data fetching using GraphQL and implementing client-side filtering. I also focused on developing the hero section and the overall layout.

While working on this project, I made efforts to ensure the responsiveness of the page. Although there is some repetitive code that could be consolidated, time constraints prevented me from addressing this issue. Similarly, certain theming values could have been moved to the theme configuration file of Tailwind CSS instead of being hardcoded and duplicated throughout the codebase. Additionally, I would have liked to include a type generator for GraphQL to generate types for all the data queries made to contentful.

Overall, I did not encounter any significant difficulties during the exercise, except for the aforementioned minor issues that I had to prioritize in order to optimize my time and deliver as many functionalities as possible. I hope you appreciate my approach to this assessment. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me. I am more than happy to provide further clarification. ðŸ˜Š
